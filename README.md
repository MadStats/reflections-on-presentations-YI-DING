# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation:Fragile Family

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Their intro of the raw data/ variable explanation&selection are clear and well structured, easy to catch up.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: They could spend more time on the details of their modeling and refinery of the model. I don't quite get  





Title of presentation:Mass shooting 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The graphs. So many amazing graphs. Wish I could have that level of command.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:Fancy plots but a little bit hard for me to interpret intuitively.  The only group to present with script on hands?  The clusting with response value thing is just....new to me, personally 





Title of presentation: YELP  

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The methods are pretty new to me. Willing to dig deeper. Sentiment analysis in yelp sounds so attractive. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:Why loess? Don't quite understand. Would it be better to have loess plots to show how ys changes with x partially? 






Title of presentation:Chicago Crimes

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The way they arrange their unit of analysis as blocks really interests me..(hot spot analysis )  Again   amazing plots .  The model/test output are just so clear........ easy to make comparison. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:not really so much to criticize..for me.  Maybe include more summaries on the results? Maybe refining on thesis statements?
