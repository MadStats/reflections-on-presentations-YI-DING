# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation:Fragile Family
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Their intro of the raw data/ variable explanation&selection are clear and well structured, easy to catch up.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: They could spend more time on the details of their modeling and refinery of the model. I don't quite get  





Title of presentation:Mass shooting 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The graphs. So many amazing graphs. Wish I could have that level of command.
What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:Fancy plots but a little bit hard for me to interpret intuitively.  The only group to present with script on hands?  The clusting with response value thing is just....new to me, personally 





Title of presentation: YELP  

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The methods are pretty new to me. Willing to dig deeper. Sentiment analysis in yelp sounds so attractive. 
What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:Why loess? Don't quite understand. Would it be better to have loess plots to show how ys changes with x partially?

Title of presentation:Chicago Crimes

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The way they arrange their unit of analysis as blocks really interests me..(hot spot analysis )  Again   amazing plots .  The model/test output are just so clear........ easy to make comparison. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:not really so much to criticize..for me.  Maybe include more summaries on the results? Maybe refining on thesis statements?


 

Title of presentation: LOL

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I play Dota2.... I look at MOBA analysis a lot...     Nice slides (prezi) 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: I can understand all of the background knowledge since I used to play MOBA....But I can tell most of the audiences are pretty confused....... It just needs great efforts to inform the audiences of the necessary knowledges within such short time. 



Title of presentation: H1B  

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Okay.  Plots are all fairly pretty.  Abundunt number of methods used. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:The radar plot takes me very long time to understand. Not that intuitive I think. 




Title of presentation: Car accident 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Clear data description, data summary. Taking the ratio of death number and population is really a wise way to do. By far this is the group with the clearest overall structure. The explanations of the plots are pretty down to earth(e.g. why theres are straight line in the residual plot, why the boxplot has some parts that has less data points)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: ....... I just like the presentation overall. Maybe try using some other models that have greater interpretability?





Title of presentation:Playing with Lyrics 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Just so interesting!! And fancy plots. Super interesting methodologies!

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Like Karl said...Presentation time management?





Title of presentation:NBA 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Definitely interesting topics, self-explanatory plots

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: It seems like most part of the presentation is about data description/plot explaning rather than models. (Appeared at last, about the salary but still lacking well-formed thesis statement)




Title of presentation:Terrorism 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Really passionate when presenting. The Hans Rosling styled animation is just FANTASTIC 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: The bugs for the animation tho...   
Again, the visualization is informative but it would be better to combine with more tests/models.  Again, the different parts seem to be divided.
